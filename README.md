# AudioBERT
AudioBERT ðŸ“¢ : Audio Knowledge Augmented Language Model

## Introduction
Language models like BERT, while powerful in text-based tasks, often lack auditory knowledge. This project introduces **AudioBERT**, a method to inject auditory knowledge into language models via a retrieval-based approach, improving performance on auditory knowledge tasks.  
To evaluate this, we introduce **AuditoryBench**, a dataset featuring tasks like animal sound recognition and sound pitch comparison. AudioBERT leverages **CLAP** (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) for effective audio-text matching.

## Dataset
### AuditoryBench
AuditoryBench is the first dataset aimed at evaluating language models' auditory knowledge. It comprises:
- **Animal Sound Recognition**: Predict the animal based on an onomatopoeic sound (e.g., "meow").
- **Sound Pitch Comparison**: Compare the pitch of different sound sources.

This dataset is built using audio-text pairs from the **LAION-Audio-630K** dataset and includes both training, development, and test sets. Further, we augment the data with audio from Wikipedia for broader generalization.

| Task                  | Train | Dev | Test | Wiki | Total |
|-----------------------|-------|-----|------|------|-------|
| Animal Sound Recognition | 4,211 | 593 | 1,211 | 197 | 6,212 |
| Sound Pitch Comparison  | 8,312 | 1,178 | 2,387 | 3,625 | 15,502 |

## Model
### AudioBERT
AudioBERT uses a retrieval-based framework to inject auditory knowledge into language models. Its key components include:
- **Auditory Knowledge Span Detector**: Identifies relevant auditory spans in text.
- **CLAP**: Retrieves relevant audio embeddings from text spans.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Dynamically adapts the model with auditory embeddings when necessary, ensuring general performance on other language tasks.
